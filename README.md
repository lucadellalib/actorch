## üõ†Ô∏èÔ∏è Installation

For Windows, make sure the latest [Visual C++ runtime](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)
is installed.

### Using Pip

First of all, install [Python](https://www.python.org). Open a terminal and run:

```
pip install actorch[visualizer]
```

If you don't need the `visualizer` (e.g. you are installing `actorch` on a headless server),
run:

```
pip install actorch
```

### Using Conda

Clone or download and extract the repository, navigate to `<path-to-repository>/bin` and run
the installation script (`install.sh` for Linux/macOS, `install.bat` for Windows).
`actorch` (including the `visualizer`) and its dependencies (pinned to a specific version) will
be installed in a [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/) virtual environment named `actorch-env`.

**NOTE**: you can directly use `actorch-env` and the `actorch` package in the local project
directory for development (see [For development](#for-development)).

### Using Docker (Linux/macOS only)

First of all, install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [NVIDIA Container Runtime](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-container-runtime).
Clone or download and extract the repository, navigate to `<path-to-repository>`, open a
terminal and run:

```
docker build -t <desired-image-name> .                  # Build image
docker run -it --runtime=nvidia <desired-image-name>    # Run container from image
```

`actorch` (including the `visualizer`) and its dependencies (pinned to a specific version) will
be installed in the specified Docker image.

**NOTE**: you can directly use the `actorch` package in the local project directory inside
a Docker container run from the specified Docker image for development (see [For development](#for-development)).

### From source

First of all, install [Python](https://www.python.org).
Clone or download and extract the repository, navigate to `<path-to-repository>`, open a
terminal and run:

```
pip install .[visualizer]
```

If you don't need the `visualizer` (e.g. you are installing `actorch` on a headless server),
run:

```
pip install .
```

### For development

First of all, install [Python](https://www.python.org) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
Clone or download and extract the repository, navigate to `<path-to-repository>`, open a
terminal and run:

```
pip install -e .[all]
pre-commit install -f
```

This will install the package in editable mode (any change to the package in the local
project directory will automatically reflect on the environment-wide package installed
in the `site-packages` directory of your environment) along with its development, test
and optional dependencies.
Additionally, it installs a [git commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).
Each time you commit, unit tests, static type checkers, code formatters and linters are
run automatically. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to check that the hook was successfully
installed. For more details, see `pre-commit`'s [documentation](https://pre-commit.com).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quickstart

In this example we will solve the [OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/) environment
`CartPole-v1` using REINFORCE.
Copy the following configuration in a file named `REINFORCE_CartPole-v1.py` (with the
same indentation):

```
import gym
from torch.optim import Adam

from actorch import *


experiment_params = ExperimentParams(
    run_or_experiment=REINFORCE,
    stop={"training_iteration": 30},
    resources_per_trial={"cpu": 1, "gpu": 0},
    checkpoint_freq=10,
    checkpoint_at_end=True,
    log_to_file=True,
    export_formats=["checkpoint", "model"],
    config=REINFORCE.Config(
        train_env_builder=lambda **config: ParallelBatchedEnv(
            lambda **config: gym.make("CartPole-v1", **config),
            config,
            num_workers=2,
        ),
        train_num_episodes_per_iteration=10,
        eval_interval_iterations=10,
        eval_env_config={"render_mode": None},
        eval_num_episodes_per_iteration=10,
        policy_network_model_builder=FCNet,
        policy_network_model_config={
            "torso_fc_configs": [
                {"out_features": 64, "bias": True}
            ],
        },
        policy_network_optimizer_builder=Adam,
        policy_network_optimizer_config={"lr": 1e-1},
        discount=0.99,
        entropy_coeff=0.001,
        max_grad_l2_norm=0.5,
        seed=0,
        enable_amp=False,
        enable_reproducibility=True,
        log_sys_usage=True,
        suppress_warnings=False,
    ),
)
```

Open a terminal in the directory where you saved the configuration file and run:

```
pip install gym[classic_control]        # Install dependencies for CartPole-v1
actorch run REINFORCE_CartPole-v1.py    # Run experiment
```

Wait for a few minutes until the training has finished. The mean cumulative reward
over the last 100 episodes should exceed 475, which means that the environment has
been solved. You can now visualize the experiment progress stored in the generated
[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) files using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/):

```
cd experiments/REINFORCE_CartPole-v1/<auto-generated-experiment-name>
actorch visualize plotly tensorboard
```

You can find the generated plots in `plots`.

Congratulations, you have run your first experiment!

**NOTE**: if you installed `actorch` in a virtual environment, you first need to activate
it (`conda activate actorch-env` if you installed `actorch` using Conda).

**HINT**: since a configuration file is a regular Python script, you can use all the
features of the language (e.g. inheritance).
